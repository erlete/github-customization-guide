# GitHub Customization Guide

This repository has the sole purpose of helping those who want to customize their GitHub profiles and/or repository READMEs in an extended way, so that they can reach their goal following an easy path.

# Getting Started

In order to start understanding the concepts that this collection of chapters covers, take a look at the [repository site](https://erlete.github.io/github-customization-guide/).

Although chapters can be accessed independently, I strongly recommend that you follow the proposed learning path, since this way you will not skip any necessary concept.

# Accreditations and Licensing

All legal requirements from third-party projects have been carefully examined and met. This repository is not, in any way, a distribution of the contents cited in [the sources](https://erlete.github.io/github-customization-guide/accreditations/sources.html), but a way of promoting the work of the respective authors of each individual project.

**I ([erlete]()) only take credit for the research labor related to this guide and its elaboration.**
