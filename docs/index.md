The main objective of this project is to provide with a friendly learning interface that effectively eases the process of understanding the variety of options avaliable for customizing your GitHub profile in an extended way. Note that many explanations in this project have been legally extracted from other developers' repositories, so I encourage you to go and take a look at [their work](https://erlete.github.io/github-customization-guide/accreditations/sources.html), which deserves tons of appreciation.
